# NARN — eCFR Data Scripts

Scripts for discovering, enriching, and monitoring CAFO-relevant federal regulations from the [eCFR](https://www.ecfr.gov/) (Electronic Code of Federal Regulations).

---

## Overview

These scripts maintain a CSV database of CFR documents relevant to CAFOs (Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations).

**One-time setup:**
```
enrich.py
```

**Ongoing workflow (run weekly):**
```
discover.py  →  monitor.py
```

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `enrich.py` | One-time setup: fills in `latest_amendment_date` and `version_flag` for the initial database by calling the eCFR versions API |
| `discover.py` | Searches the eCFR API for new CAFO-relevant regulations and appends them to the database |
| `monitor.py` | Checks existing database rows against the current eCFR API and flags any that have been amended |

---

## Setup

```bash
pip install requests
```

---

## Scripts

### `discover.py`

Searches the eCFR API across a set of CAFO-related keywords and appends genuinely new documents to the database as `Needs Review` rows.

- Deduplicates results across keyword searches and against existing database URLs
- Auto-assigns `POL_id` values continuing from the highest existing number
- Only returns documents modified after the last run date (incremental)
- Does **not** mark anything as "Included" — that requires human review

**Keywords searched:** `CAFO`, `feedlot`, `manure`, `factory farm`, `animal waste`, `land application`, `nutrient management`

```bash
cd eCFR
python3 discover.py
```

**Output:** Appends new rows to `batch_1_included_ultimate_broad_update.csv`. Updates `discover_last_run.txt` with today's date for the next incremental run.

---

### `enrich.py` _(one-time setup)_

Enriches existing database rows with amendment dates from the eCFR versions API.

- Fills `latest_amendment_date` with the most recent substantive change date for each section or part
- Sets `version_flag` to `Check` for any document amended after `VERSION_CHECK_AFTER`
- Ignores non-substantive edits (typo fixes, renumbering)
- Section-level URLs get that section's own amendment history; part-level URLs use the part's latest date

```bash
cd eCFR
python3 enrich.py
```

**Output:** Overwrites the input CSV in place with updated columns.

> Note: This script was primarily useful for the initial batch. For ongoing monitoring, use `monitor.py`.

---

### `monitor.py`

Checks each eCFR row in the database against the current API and flags documents that have been amended since the stored date.

- Compares stored `latest_amendment_date` against the live API date
- Updates `latest_amendment_date` and sets `version_flag` to `Check` for any changes
- Writes a `version_report.txt` summarizing what changed
- Only rewrites the CSV if changes were actually detected
- Does **not** clear existing `Check` flags — that's done manually after human review

```bash
cd eCFR
python3 monitor.py
```

**Output:** `needs_review_docs_monitored.csv` and `version_report_needs_review_docs.txt`.

Intended to run weekly or after any known eCFR update.
